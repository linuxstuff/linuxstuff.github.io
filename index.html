<p><strong>Steps in chef-cliet run</strong>
 * <strong>http://docs.getchef.com/essentials<em>nodes</em>chef_run.html</strong> 
 * <strong>Get configuration data</strong>:  local client.rb file + ohai 
 * <strong>Authenticate to the Chef Server</strong>: RSA priv key + node name against chef API
 * <strong>Get, rebuild the node object</strong>: node object is rebuild 
 * <strong>Expand the run-list</strong>: ..
 * <strong>Synchronize cookbooks</strong>: gets the list of cookbooks, compare with existing files in cache. Chef client is able to request the cookbooks at the beginning
 * <strong>Reset node attributes</strong>: All attributes in the rebuilt node object are updated with the attribute data according to attribute precedence
 * <strong>Compile the resource collection</strong>: "The chef-client identifies each resource in the node object and builds the resource collection....Finally, all recipes are loaded in the order specified by the expanded run-list." 
 * <strong>Converge the node</strong>: "Each resource is executed in the order identified by the run-list, and then by the order in which each resource is listed in each recipe."
 * <strong>Update the node object, process exception and report handlers</strong>: "chef-client updates the node object on the Chef server with the node object that was built during this chef-client run...exception and report handlers are executed"
 * <strong>Stop, wait for the next run</strong> </p>
